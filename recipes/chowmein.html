    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chow mein is a popular Chinese dish of stir fried noodles with mix vegetables, soy sauce, aromatics and spices. My street style veg chowmein recipe is a delightful Indo-Chinese fusion. This vegan dish is a savory masterpiece of smooth, velvety noodles and oodles of crunchy veggies. You’re sure to fall in love with this Asian noodles dish; it is utterly slurp-able to the last bite.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>For Cooking Noodles</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>150 to 200 grams hakka noodles – swap with plain or whole wheat noodles, soba noodles or flat noodles or chow mein noodles</li>

        <li>2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil or any neutral flavored oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For Cornstarch Slurry – Optional</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 teaspoons cornstarch</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Other Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2.5 to 3 tablespoons oil – any neutral flavored oil</li>
        <li>2 to 3 teaspoons finely chopped green chilies (skip if making for small kids) or add ¾ to 1 teaspoon spicy red chili sauce or green chili sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon finely chopped ginger</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon finely chopped garlic</li>
        <li>⅓ cup finely chopped onions or ⅓ cup chopped spring onion whites – reserve the spring onion greens for garnish</li>
        <li>¾ to 1 cup chopped button mushrooms</li>
        <li>¼ to ⅓ cup finely chopped french beans</li>
        <li>¾ cup grated carrots or shredded carrots</li>
        <li>¾ cup shredded cabbage – green or purple cabbage</li>
        <li>¼ cup thinly sliced capsicum (bell pepper) – can use green or yellow or red bell pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon finely chopped celery – optional</li>
        <li>¼ cup sprouts – optional</li>

    <ul>
        <li>1 to 2 teaspoon toasted sesame seeds</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Cooking Noodles</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook noodles according to the package instructions. The noodles don't need to be cooked till al dente. Since towards the end we will be just tossing the noodles with the stir fried veggies. But if you prefer you can cook them until al dente.</li>
        <li>Drain the water from the cooked noodles in a colander. Rinse noodles in running water very well. This method stops the cooking process.</li>
        <li>Add toasted sesame oil to the noodles. Toss them well, so that the oil gets coated evenly on the noodles. This method gets rid of stickiness from the noodles. Cover and keep the noodles aside.</li>
        <li>When the noodles are cooking, you can chop and grate the veggies.</li>
        <li>Prepare corn starch slurry or paste with the cornstarch and water. Keep aside.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Making Chow Mein</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a pan or wok. On medium heat, first saute the green chilies, ginger and garlic for about 30 seconds. Green chilies add quite some heat in the dish. Skip if you do not prefer them or if making for kids.</li>
        <li>Add chopped onions or spring onions. Saute for a minute.</li>
        <li>Add sliced mushrooms and finely chopped french beans.</li>
        <li>Stir and saute on a medium heat till the edges of the mushroom get lightly browned.</li>
        <li>Add grated carrots, shredded cabbage and sliced bell pepper (capsicum).</li>
        <li>Stir and increase the heat to a high. Stir fry everything on a high heat for 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add soy sauce. At this step you can also add tomato sauce or red chili sauce or green chili sauce. Since I have already added green chilies, I have not added the chili sauce.</li>
        <li>Season with ground black pepper or white pepper and salt as required. Mix well. At this step you can opt to add sprouts or tofu. Add them and stir fry for a minute.</li>
        <li>Lower the heat and add the cornstarch paste. Stir the cornstarch paste in the bowl very well before adding to the stir fried vegetables.</li>
        <li>Mix and sauté for a minute on medium-low heat.</li>
        <li>Add the cooked noodles. Increase the heat to high. Mix and toss the noodles with the stir fried veggies.</li>
        <li>Lastly add vinegar and give a final mix to chowmein. Switch off the heat.</li>
        <li>Serve chow mein steaming hot in serving bowls.</li>
        <li>You can also garnish chowmein with about 1 to 2 teaspoon toasted sesame seeds and some chopped spring onion greens.</li>
    </ol>
